## About
Given a functional site with suboptimal search engine optimization, the task was to properly optimize code, remove redundancies, and add semantic elements to HTML. The end result is a site that loads much faster and takes up less space on the web while retaining functionality for the user.


## Description
HTML changes made:

* Added proper page title

* Used header tag for top header portion

* Added abbr tag for abbrevation in title

* Added nav tag to navigation links

* Main element used for main page content, removed redundant classes for each child article

* Added ID for search engine optimization for proper nav linking

* Renamed div to aside for side elements and section for each child element

* Renamed footer div to footer element

* Reordered Head elements for proper sequential order on page

CSS changes made:

* Moved reoccuring font family to universal, only header and footer differs

* Changed header, nav, main, and aside calls to match html code

* Removed unnessecary class callings now being used by new elements
